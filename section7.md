## Section 7: Working with Inheritance

## 7.1 Describing Inheritance and its benefits
- Inheritance lets one class use the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) of another class
- The class that inherits is called the subclass (or child class)
- The class being inherited from is the superclass (or parent class)
- Use the extends keyword to implement inheritance in Java
- A subclass can reuse code from the superclass and add its own unique methods or fields
- One superclass can have many subclasses, but a subclass can only inherit from one superclass (Java supports single inheritance)
- *Subclass inherits members of a superclass ONLY if it has access to them*
