## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).


## DEFINITIONS LEARNED
- Java Virtual Machine(JVM) is responsible for the hardware- and operating system-independence of the Java SE platform, the small size of compiled code (bytecodes), and platform security

## Other Important Things Learned
- I CAN LABEL MY LOOPS
- Java passes everything by value
    - For primitives, the value is just a number
    - For objects, the value is the memory address (reference)
